  <h2> Rajasthan </h2>
  <p> Soaked in cultural richness and tradition, Rajasthan is very welcoming and is sure to give you a majestic experience. Forget about everything else as you revisit the lifestyle of the Rajputs and pamper yourself with shopping, food and exceptional sightseeing <br />
  When in Rajasthan, the single word that comes to mind to describe the place is ‘royal’. With the Aravallis as its backdrop, this magical state is no less than regal, resplendent and remarkable. The beautiful architecture of the palaces with their intricate detailing and colourful and vibrant hues are a delight for the eyes and senses. The lofty forts and age-old temples of Jaipur, Udaipur, Jodhpur and Jaisalmer are testimony to Rajasthan’s glorious past.</p>
